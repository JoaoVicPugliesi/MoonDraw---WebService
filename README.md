# Software Design

To implement the use cases within our application, we defined several contracts—DTOs, Repositories, Providers, and Services—that collectively enable operations such as retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting various entities and managing their relationships.

To ensure a well-structured and maintainable solution, we followed Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. This approach emphasizes understanding the business problem in its broader context and expressing that understanding within our domain layer. Before considering how to structure the infrastructure layer or implement contracts, we first needed to validate the business logic independently.

For this reason, we adopted a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, ensuring that every use case scenario is thoroughly tested and that our domain remains decoupled from infrastructure dependencies.

Additionally, we incorporated several Clean Architecture principles, including patterns like repositories, composition, and dependency injection. We also followed the S.O.L.I.D principles, which challenged us to be critical and continuously improve our code:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Encouraged us to respect each class's purpose, keeping responsibilities well-defined.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Highlighted the importance of defining contracts to keep our system extendable without modifying existing code.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Allowed us to substitute implementations easier by using Factories and Decorators without affecting layers of our application.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Reinforced the need to properly use interfaces, defining contracts within DTOs and Repositories. Also making possible inheritence among different interfaces.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Helped us build a flexible and maintainable system by abstracting dependencies, ensuring business logic remains unaffected by infrastructure changes.

By adhering to these principles, we created a scalable, maintainable, and resilient e-commerce WebService.
